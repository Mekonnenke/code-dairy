                <h2> Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>
                <h5>Written by Mekonnen Mohammed <br>December, 2019</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The evolution of machine Intelligence and its implication in people’s lives
                     can describe in different ways.  Artificial Intelligence has brought an enormous 
                     change in the development of various technology sectors and simplification of
                      people’s lives; however, the future of this system will be unpredictable in many ways.
                       The scenario of this research report has held various type of information together
                        to create clear idea about the development and future impact of Artificial Intelligence,
                         so scientific innovation, artistic events, and development of compiler role 
                         include in this research to bring forward the progress of this research report. 
                         The development of Artificial Intelligence can divide in three main chapters: The Past history 
                         of AI, Present AI, and Future AI. 
         
                </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3> Defining Artificial Intelligence </h3>
                   
                <p>Before the first chapter, having some information regarding AI is important. Margaret (August 2018, 
                    Artificial Intelligence) explains that AI is a multidisciplinary computer science branch that 
                    can imitate human intelligence into a machine intelligence system by using processing progress (P.1). ” 
                    These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), 
                    reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications
                     of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.” Margaret Rouse, August 2018, Artificial
                      Intelligence (AI).

                <h3> Week and Strong AI </h3>
                <p>
                    The advancement of Artificial Intelligence and the capacity of manipulating this system helped to come through 
                    identifying Machine Intelligence. According to Margaret (August 2018, Artificial Intelligence) 
                    “Artificial Intelligence can categorize either weak or strong” (P.1). Margaret (August 2018, 
                    Artificial Intelligence) explained that Narrow Artificial Intelligence (weak AI) is the present 
                    artificial intelligence that design and train to practice tasks, and it is more successful. Self-Drive 
                    cars, IBM, and SIRI can be examples for Narrow Artificial Intelligence. Strong Artificial Intelligence
                     (AGI) is a human level or a supper-minded machine intelligence. It can perform different, unusual, and
                      complicated tasks when it is going to apply in the future. (P.1)
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3> Types of Artificial Intelligence. </h3>
                <p>
                    Margaret (August 2018, Artificial Intelligence) divides Artificial Intelligence into four types i.e.
                    “from the kind of AI systems that exist today to sentimental systems which do not yet exist” (P.2).
                 </p>
                 <br><br>
                 <p><span></span><strong>Reactive Machines</strong></span>
                    don’t have any memory to recall the past experience to make 
                    a decision in the present situation. They tend to follow a plan of reaction in the
                    current existing conditions. For example, Deep Blue, a chess playing machine was designed for
                    a narrow purpose and defeated the cheese champion Garry Kasparov in the 1990s (P.2).
                </p>
                   <br><br>
                <p><span></span><strong>Limited memory</strong></span> 
                    is acquiring knowledge from past learned information, stored data or events, so they can go to
                     the past for a short time and recognize things from it. Driverless are the main examples to 
                     show how machines can use the principle of limited Memory. A car lane change can be an example in
                    the self-drive car because it uses a consideration to determine which is the best strategy, and it
                     doesn’t save constantly (P.2).
                </p>
                     <br><br>
                <p> <span></span><strong>Theory of Mind</strong></span> 
                    is a machine that has equal ability and consciousness to explain their feelings as humans. 
                    These machines expect to include recognizing 
                    abilities of humankind such as understanding of thought and explaining feelings and emotions.
                     This AI will exist in the future (P.2). 
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p> <span></span><strong>Self-Awareness</strong></span> 
                    is the highest type of AI which is being conscious and self-aware to identify who
                     they are. This AI can know their actual situation although they can easily understand
                      other interests (P.2). The present situation of AI is not close to the level of Self -Aware machine
                       progress, but the past history of AI helps to look toward the future AI. </p>
